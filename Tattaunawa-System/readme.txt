We employ the following processes in actualizing the Tattaunawa system (Speech Recognition / Language  Translator).

A pilot test-run of our speech recognition system has shown several successful results:
The system can capture human speech via a microphone and convert the signal into text on a screen. 
Presently, the speech recognition system supports the Chrome Browser, Microsoft Edge platform, 
and we envisage scaling to other browser environments and mobile platforms (Android and iOS).
 
The speech recognition system allows a user to translate from English text into
the three major languages (Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba) and supports cross-language transformation. 
These features have shown to be beneficial to our pilot users. 
Because our product demonstrated to improve our user dictation skills in both English and their 
local dialect vocabulary. Additionally, children with disabilities can use the system as a virtual 
assistance tool to bridge their physical gap. 
   
The aforementioned test run has been validated on 19 children in the age range of 6-15 years.
We collected their bio-information and educational status for onward tracking and monitoring. 
To this effect, we are currently building a database to archive the data which will be used across 
all caregiving homes in Nigeria. The archived data will aid in collaborative tracking of childrenâ€™s 
educational development in real-time.
